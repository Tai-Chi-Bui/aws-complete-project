# aws-complete-project
A realistic and complex AWS project that covers all aspects of a professional application.

## Prerequisite Technologies

[1] Github Account
Github will be used to store our application code.

[2] Gipod Account
Gitpod will be used as our Cloud Developer Environment (CDE).
We will be writing code in Gitpod as we integrate cloud services to our application.

Note: we need to install Gitpod Chrome extension to have its Gipod button attached to our Github repository.

[3] Github Codespaces Account
Github Codespaces will be used as our alternative CDE in case we use up Gitpod's free tier.

[4] AWS Account
AWS will be our Cloud Service Provider (CSPs).

[5] Momento Account
Momento offers serverless cache.

To keep the costs down, we will cache DynamoDB requests using Momento Serverless Cache service.

[6] Lucid Charts
Lucid Charts will be used to build Architecture diagram.

[7] HoneyComb.io
HoenyComb will be used for distributed tracing.

[8] Rollbar Account
Rollbar is a bug tracking tool for production application. It will help us capture uncaught errors, application crashes and slow response.
